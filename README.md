This project was created by **Dima Kumankov**, a Year 2 student in class 2JM, as a way to learn about coding and game design. With a little help from AI and his Dad, Dima built a game where you can grow your own BISP campus!

Start by clicking to study, then hire students and teachers, build real BISP facilities, and eventually graduate to earn prestige bonuses!
